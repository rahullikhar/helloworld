# Get input from the user
a = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
b = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
c = float(input("Enter the third number: "))

# Find the maximum using nested ternary operators
# This can be a bit less readable for three numbers compared to if/else,
# but fulfills the requirement of using the ternary operator.
maximum = a if (a > b and a > c) else (b if (b > c) else c)

# Print the maximum number
print(f"The maximum of {a}, {b}, and {c}) is: {maximum}")

# Alternative using the max() function (more Pythonic but doesn't use ternary)
# print(f"The maximum of {a}, {b}, and {c} is: {max(a, b, c)}")
